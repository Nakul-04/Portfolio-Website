    <p>
        Hello, I'm Nakul, a passionate individual currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at KIET Group of Institutions in Delhi NCR, specifically in Ghaziabad. I have always been drawn to the world of technology and programming, which led me to develop proficiency in web development technologies such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

In addition to web development, I am also dedicated to enhancing my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with C++. I find the world of competitive programming intriguing, as it challenges me to think critically and creatively to solve complex problems efficiently.

Hailing from the vibrant city of Lucknow, I am determined to continue my journey in the world of technology. My future plans include diving into the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack, as it represents the cutting-edge of web development and promises exciting opportunities for innovation.

In summary, I am a driven and tech-savvy student, constantly expanding my skill set and knowledge in the field of computer science. I am excited about the future and eager to make a positive impact through my work in the world of technology.
